          <p>
            In an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the government
            continues to improve and innovate, one of which is by creating
            digital-based public services. Recently, the Indonesian government
            through the Ministry of Law and Human Rights of the Republic of
            Indonesia launched an electronic visa service (e-Visa) which aims to
            provide convenience in providing services to the public, especially
            in pandemic conditions like today. In addition, the implementation
            of this e-Visa service also brings a positive message for
            prospective foreign tourists who want to visit Indonesia after the
            pandemic ends.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            By providing easy access for prospective tourists, it is hoped that
            the development of Indonesia's tourism and creative economy will
            also increase after the pandemic, of course accompanied by preparing
            safe tourism destinations.With this service, Foreign Citizens (WNA)
            no longer need to come directly to the Indonesian Representative
            abroad or the Directorate General of Immigration to take care of,
            pick up, or stick visa stickers on passports. Through the e-Visa
            service, foreigners who intend to enter Indonesia now only need to
            apply for a visa online.
          </p>
          <h2>How to Apply for Your Visa</h2>
          <p>Here are the steps to apply for an e-Visa:</p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>Open the page https://visa-online.imigrasi.go.id/</li>
            <li>Register</li>
            <li>
              Input data and upload personal data requirements
              (individual/corporate)
            </li>
            <li>Wait for the notification with username and password</li>
            <li>Apply for Visa Approval</li>
            <li>
              Log in to the application using the username and password sent to
              you
            </li>
            <li>
              Select the type of visa to be applied for, input data, and upload
              required documents
            </li>
            <li>
              Make PNBP payment (make sure the data input and requirements are
              correct, because if rejected the payment cannot be withdrawn)
            </li>
            <li>If approved, you will get a notification via e-mail</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
            The e-Visa application can be done wherever the applicant is. The
            verification process will be carried out faster, namely 2 (two)
            working days, the visa will be sent to the applicant. In order to
            cut the bureaucracy, both the applicant and the guarantor will no
            longer meet physically, but will be sent directly via electronic
            mail. If foreign nationals have received an e-Visa, they can
            immediately travel to Indonesia. Well, this ease of access is one of
            the points to support the development of tourism in Indonesia after
            the pandemic. With this innovation, it is hoped that prospective
            tourists who intend to visit Indonesian tourism destinations after
            the pandemic will also increase.
          </p>

          <h1><span class="warna">Time</span> Difference</h1>
          <img src="/pengudang.discover.co.id/assets/time-difference.png" alt="Time Difference" />
          <p>
            Indonesia spans multiple time zones, given its vast geographical
            extent. The country follows three main time zones: Western Indonesia
            Time (WIB), Central Indonesia Time (WITA), and Eastern Indonesia
            Time (WIT). Western Indonesia Time (WIB) is the standard time for
            the western part of Indonesia, including the capital city Jakarta
            and Bintan Island. WIB is UTC+7 hours. Central Indonesia Time (WITA)
            is observed in the central region of Indonesia, including Bali,
            Makassar, and Sulawesi. WITA is UTC+8 hours. Eastern Indonesia Time
            (WIT) is used in the eastern part of Indonesia, encompassing regions
            such as Papua and the Maluku Islands. WIT is UTC+9 hours. It's
            important to note that Indonesia does not observe daylight saving
            time, so the time difference remains consistent throughout the year.
            However, some regions in Indonesia may have slight variations due to
            local customs or regional preferences. When traveling or scheduling
            events in Indonesia, it's advisable to consider the specific time
            zone of the area you'll be in to avoid any confusion or
            inconvenience.

            When visiting Indonesia, it's important to familiarize yourself with
            the local currency and understand how to handle your finances during
            your stay. The official currency of Indonesia is the Rupiah (IDR),
            which is issued and controlled by the Bank of Indonesia. This
            article will provide useful information on Indonesian currency,
            where to buy and exchange it, and the accessibility of ATMs
            throughout the country.

              <h2>Understanding Indonesian Currency</h2>
              <p>
                The Indonesian Rupiah is denoted by the currency symbol Rp and
                has the currency code IDR. By law, all transactions within
                Indonesia must be conducted in Rupiah. The daily exchange rate
                can be found in newspapers, through online sources, or mobile
                apps. It's worth noting that credit cards are widely accepted in
                hotels, large restaurants, and major stores, making it
                convenient for travelers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Indonesian banknotes come in denominations of IDR1000, IDR2000,
                IDR5000, IDR10000, IDR20000, IDR50000, and IDR100000. Coins in
                circulation include IDR1000, IDR500, IDR200, IDR100, and IDR50.
                Ensure you have a mix of smaller denominations for ease of
                transactions, especially in rural non-tourist areas.
              </p>
              <br /><br />
              <h2>Where to Buy and Exchange Currency</h2>
              <p>
                Foreign currency can be exchanged at banks and money changers in
                major cities throughout Indonesia. Tourist resorts generally
                have money changer facilities, but if you're traveling to more
                remote areas, it's advisable to exchange your money beforehand.
                For larger currency amounts, it's best to place an order at your
                bank a day in advance, especially if you don't have a foreign
                currency account.

          <p>
            When traveling to Indonesia, understanding the country's electricity
            standards and connectivity options is essential for a smooth and
            convenient stay. This article provides insights into the electrical
            voltage, plug types, charging facilities, Wi-Fi accessibility, and
            obtaining local SIM cards to help foreign visitors stay connected
            and prepared during their trip.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>Electricity in Indonesia</h2>
          <p>
            The standard voltage in Indonesia is typically 230 V, with a
            frequency of 50 Hz. If you are from the UK, Europe, Australia, or
            most parts of Asia or Africa, your electronic devices can be charged
            using the standard voltage. However, travelers from the United
            States, Canada, and most South American countries may need a voltage
            converter due to the voltage difference. It is advisable to consider
            purchasing a voltage converter before your trip to ensure
            compatibility and prevent any potential risks.
          </p>
          <h2>Plug Types</h2>
          <p>
            Most power plugs and sockets in Indonesia follow type C and F, which
            are the standard European plugs with two pins. If your home country
            uses a different plug type, it is recommended to carry an adapter.
            Adapters can be easily purchased from online retailers like Amazon
            or local minimarkets throughout Indonesia.
          </p>
          <h2>Charging Facilities</h2>
          <p>
            Charging facilities are readily available in most restaurants,
            tourist attractions, hotels, airports, and public transportation in
            Indonesia. You can find sockets to charge your gadgets, and many
            places also offer USB ports for convenience. It is advisable to
            carry your own charging cables and adapters to ensure compatibility
            with the available charging facilities.
          </p>
          <br /><br /><br />
          <img src="/pengudang.discover.co.id/assets/electricity.png" alt="Electricity" />
          <br />
          <h2>Wi-Fi and Connectivity in Public Space</h2>
          <p>
            ATMs connected to international networks like Plus/Cirrus or Alto
            are easily accessible in major Indonesian cities and tourist
            destinations. However, be aware that withdrawal limits may depend on
            your home bank. ATMs typically dispense IDR50,000 or IDR100,000
            denomination notes, as indicated on the machine. Keep in mind that
            larger notes can be more difficult to split, particularly in rural
            non-tourist areas. To ensure you have cash on hand, it's recommended
            to withdraw money from ATMs in major cities before venturing into
            more secluded destinations.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Understanding the currency of Indonesia is essential for a smooth
            and hassle-free travel experience. The Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) is
            the official currency, and it is widely accepted throughout the
            country. Familiarize yourself with the banknotes and coins, and
            consider exchanging foreign currency at banks or money changers in
            major cities. Utilize ATMs, which are accessible in tourist areas,
            but be mindful of withdrawal limits and note denominations. By being
            prepared and knowledgeable about Indonesian currency, you can
            confidently manage your finances during your visit to this beautiful
            archipelago.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>Obtaining Local SIM Cards</h2>
          <p>
            For reliable and continuous connectivity, obtaining a local SIM card
            is a practical option. SIM cards from providers such as Telkomsel,
            XL, Smartfren, 3/Tri, Axis, and Indosat/IM3 can be found at airports
            and various mobile provider booths. Prices start from IDR 10,000.
            Foreign visitors will need to present their passport or relevant
            identification (such as KITAS or KITAP for long-term stays) to
            register the SIM card, and the provider's staff will guide you
            through the registration process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Understanding the electrical standards, plug types, and connectivity
            options in Indonesia ensures a seamless experience for foreign
            visitors. By carrying the necessary adapters or voltage converters,
            utilizing available charging facilities, and staying connected
            through Wi-Fi or local SIM cards, visitors can easily stay connected
            and navigate the country. Embrace the convenience of technology
            while immersing yourself in the rich culture and breathtaking beauty
            that Indonesia has to offer.

              <p>
                Indonesia is home to over 200 ethnic groups, residing across its
                13,400 islands. The population of approximately 200 million
                comprises various ethnicities, each with their own languages and
                dialects. While the Javanese and Sundanese are the most populous
                groups, numbering around 70 million and 30 million respectively,
                there are also smaller communities residing on remote islands.
                Inter-marriages among different ethnic groups since gaining
                independence in 1945 have contributed to a more cohesive
                Indonesian nation.

              <h3>Religious Practices</h3>
              <p>
                The dominant religion in Indonesia is Islam, with a majority of
                the population adhering to this faith. However, Bali stands out
                as an island where Hinduism is prevalent. In other regions, such
                as the Minahasa in North Sulawesi, the Toraja highlands in South
                Sulawesi, and parts of Papua, the majority are either Catholics
                or Protestants. Indonesian society, in general, is religious in
                nature, and people hold their beliefs with reverence and
                respect.

              <h2>Tolerance and Unity</h2>
              <p>
                The Indonesian people embrace the principles of Pancasila, which
                advocate belief in the One and Only God, a Just and Civilized
                Humanity, the Unity of Indonesia, Democracy through unanimous
                deliberations, and Social Justice for all. These principles
                shape Indonesian society to be open, tolerant, and respectful of
                different religions, customs, and traditions. While upholding
                their own beliefs, Indonesians demonstrate unity in diversity,
                as reflected in the national motto: "Bhinneka Tunggal Ika"
                meaning "Unity in Diversity."

          <br />

            As a visitor, it is important to show respect and cultural
            sensitivity during your stay in Indonesia. Here are a few guidelines
            to follow:
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul>

              rural areas.

            <li>
              Greet locals with a smile and a polite greeting, as this gesture
              is highly appreciated.
            </li>
            <li>
              Seek permission before taking photographs of individuals or
              religious ceremonies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Be mindful of local customs and traditions, such as removing shoes
              before entering homes or temples.
            </li>
            <li>
              Avoid public displays of affection, as they may be considered
              inappropriate in certain areas.
            </li>
            <li>
              Engage in conversations with an open mind, showing genuine
              interest in the local culture and customs.
            </li>
            <li>

              the Indonesian people and their traditions, you will forge
              meaningful connections and create lasting memories during your
              visit to this remarkable nation.

          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
